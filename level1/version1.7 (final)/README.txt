README for version 1.7 (final)
22-05-2013

Removed task and repeated the "task" code everywhere (or wherever it was called). No particular success though. Output is nearly the same as v1.6.

This code was implemented in the experimental setup with sensor and traffic light interfacing.

The CASE III output of v1.6 was observed:
CASE III: It starts with T1, then it toggles among T2, T3 and T4, and doesn't return to T1 again.
