README for version 1.5
07-04-2013

This version marks the successful functional verification of the v1.4 code in ModelSim (without using clock division).

The code, which was written in v1.4 was to make sure the synthesis in Quartus II is proper. After that, to check the logic, once again the code's functional verification was done in ModelSim. Some changes were made in the code to achieve that and thus comes the v1.5 code!
